# Physics Essay Grading with AI Models
This repository is part of a research project conducted by [UW-Madison Skunkworks](https://skunkworks.engr.wisc.edu), which focuses on leveraging AI models to assess students' understanding of key physics concepts, including Kinetic Energy, Potential Energy, and the Law of Conservation of Energy. The project aims to streamline the grading process for physics essays and provide valuable feedback to students, educators, and researchers. In the future, we plan to expand our models to more than just these concepts and topics.
## Project Goals
- Develop and test AI models, including FLAN-T5, BLOOM, and ROBERTA models, to grade physics essays effectively.
- Use the Checklist NLP testing model to evaluate the quality and accuracy of the grading models.
- Contribute to the improvement of AI-driven educational tools
## Features
- Integration of state-of-the-art AI models for grading.
- Utilization of the Checklist NLP testing model to enhance model evaluation.
## Model Evaluation
We employ the [Checklist](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist) NLP testing model to evaluate the performance of our AI grading models through linguistic capability tests.
